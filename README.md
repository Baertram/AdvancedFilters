Finally, Advanced Filters! The default inventory has type filters, but they're still WAY too broad. This add-on fixes that!

*Features*:

*Subfilters for each of the 5 main filter types!

*Main inventory, personal bank and guild bank support!

*Custom icon work that makes the add-on feel like it came with the game! (more coming soon!)

*Empty subfilters are greyed out and inaccessible to help save you time searching!

*Shortens the time you need to find an item in your inventory!

*German, French, Russian, and Spanish localization!

*NEW in 0.7.0!*

Extensible filter system allows addon authors to make their own filters to add to Advanced Filters' dropdown filter menu! See included documentation for details.

*Special thanks to*:

mescaline - German translations

kaats, Ykses - French translations
